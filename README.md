## Hi there 👋

📱 Mobile Price Predictor
📌 Project Overview

The Mobile Price Predictor is a machine learning-based web application that predicts smartphone prices based on their specifications. The model is trained on a dataset containing mobile phone features such as Brand, RAM, Storage, Processor, Display size, Camera, and Battery capacity.

This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model building, and deployment using Streamlit.

🚀 Features

Predicts mobile phone price based on input features.

User-friendly Streamlit web app.

Auto-selects all features when a brand & model are chosen.

Supports multiple smartphone brands and models.

Interactive UI with background image integration.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pickle)

Streamlit (Web Application)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (EDA & Model Training)

📊 Methodology

Data Collection & Cleaning – Raw data collected from Flipkart, preprocessed into structured format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identified trends and relationships in features like RAM, Storage, Battery, etc.

Feature Engineering – Encoded categorical features, handled missing values, and normalized data.

Model Training – Trained multiple ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) and selected the best pipeline.

Deployment – Built an interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.
